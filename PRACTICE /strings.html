<!--For the first getElementById("demo"), you're simply displaying the original 
string "Misogynist". This works as expected.

For getElementById("demo2"), you're using split(".") on a string that doesn't contain any periods. 
Then you're joining the resulting array with commas. Since there are no periods to split on, 
this operation effectively does nothing, and texter will be the same as the original text ("Misogynist").

For getElementById("demo3"), you're using split(",") on a string that doesn't contain any commas.
 Then you're reversing the resulting array. Since there are no commas to split on, this creates 
 an array with a single element, 
and reversing it does nothing. So txt will also be the same as the original text ("Misogynist").-->
